## deepDB

Richard Socher, Danqi Chen, et al.'s code of a [neural tensor network](http://www.socher.org/index.php/Main/ReasoningWithNeuralTensorNetworksForKnowledgeBaseCompletion) for knowledge base completion. Re-posted here to include customizations. Original code at http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/codeDeepDB.zip ( 128 MB ).

### Usage

s. README.txt

For the impatient:

```shell
matlab
```

```matlab
cd deepDB/code/
train
```

Consider customizing your parameters in defaultParams.
